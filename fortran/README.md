# The Fortan Programming Language

Fortan source code files use the file extension ".f" or ".f90".

GNU Fortran (GFortran) requires the ".f90" file extension to run it using
the Fortran 90 standard.

To compile and run a Fortran program, use commands like these:
```bash
gfortran -o hello-world hello-world.f90
./hello-world
```
